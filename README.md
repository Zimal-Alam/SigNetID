"SigNetID: Signature Recognition using CNN and Feature Engineering Techniques"

üîç Detailed Description:
SigNetID is a computer vision project focused on developing an intelligent signature verification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective is to accurately identify which individual a handwritten signature belongs to by analyzing signature images through deep learning and traditional feature extraction methods.

üìå Project Goals:
Implement and train a CNN model to classify signature images.

Evaluate CNN-based feature extraction versus manual techniques such as:

HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)

Measure and compare performance using key metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy.

Plot training and testing errors/accuracies for all models.

Provide insightful visualizations and an analytical report showcasing:

Feature maps from CNN layers

Comparisons of feature space distributions (CNN vs HOG/SIFT)

Confusion matrices and evaluation curves (ROC, Precision-Recall, etc.)

üìÇ Dataset:
Source: Kaggle Signature Verification Dataset

Contents: Contains genuine and forged signatures from multiple individuals, allowing for classification and verification tasks.

üìà Deliverables:
CNN implementation with plotted training/testing accuracy and loss curves.

Traditional feature-based classification pipelines (HOG/SIFT + ML classifier).

Comparative performance analysis with visualizations.

Final report with discussion on strengths and limitations of each approach.
